        <h3>My Pricing</h3>
        <img src="img/pro.jpg" alt="">
       
        <p>I offer a pricing structure that is based on the complexity of the project and the amount of time and effort required. For an HTML/CSS bootstrap website, I charge 10 thousand, and for a full website, I charge 20 thousand. I believe this pricing model is reasonable, especially considering the level of customization and design work that goes into building a website from scratch.

            For coding assignments, I offer a rate of 2 thousand, which I believe is fair and reasonable. Many students and professionals may find this service valuable, and I can complete these assignments within a day, which is a valuable asset.
            
            For JS, Java, or C++ projects, I charge 4 thousand, given the level of expertise required to develop software applications using these languages. It's also worth noting that I can complete big projects within a week, and assignments within a day, which can be highly beneficial for clients who need work completed quickly.
            
            Overall, I believe that my pricing model is competitive and reasonable, and my ability to deliver high-quality work within a reasonable timeframe makes me a valuable asset for clients in need of technical services.</p>
